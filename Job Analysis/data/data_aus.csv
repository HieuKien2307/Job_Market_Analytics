ABOUT MUTINEX:

We might be an early stage startup but we already have strong product market fit, household name clients (Samsung, Mars, CUB and ING to name a few) and millions in revenue.

Being early stage means we're also still pretty scrappy and you wouldn't be coming into a well oiled machine, yet. But you would get a lot of opportunity to design, build and oil the machine until it's super oily.

We aren't aiming to be another Tech Unicorn because Unicorns aren't real. We are aiming (and confident of being) more like a real and really big animal that lives for a long time, like a Bowhead Whale.

Mutinex is a startup B2B SaaS platform that provides in-depth data analytics for marketers to better understand their ROI and make better decisions with future spend.

Founded in Australia, we've hit millions in ARR & have (very!) recent funding ($5 million in May 2023 & $9.5 million in October 2023 backed by EVP, and most recently $17.5m) that we'll use for growing our team to continue to improve our product, bring in new customers and enable them to make better and more informed decisions.

We have a hybrid work environment at two days a week in the office (Monday, Friday) with teams in Sydney, Melbourne and New York.

With a team of around 70 people, we value high-quality communication, strong opinions that are held loosely and people who can give and take feedback well.
