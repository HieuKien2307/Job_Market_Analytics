Why we started Featurii

Work is such a fundamental part of life; save for the lucky few, we all have to work. It's how we provide for our family and contribute to society.

Yet, if you lose your job today, it's likely going to take you months to find a new one - even then, it might not be the best fit.

We've all become so desensitised to the lengthy job searching process, applying to job one by one, day after day, answering the same old interview questions over and over, that we no longer stop to ask why it has to be this way.

And, it's not like the employers enjoy this too. As an employer myself, I can attest to how disruptive and painful it is when an employee leaves the company. Often, the search for a replacement can take more than 3 months, and we've had roles that took us almost a year to fill.

Just to fill a role, I estimate that the average employer has to conduct at least 50 screening calls, and 20 interviews, which is a colossal waste of time and productivity.

Many accept this as the way life is for both sides.

We disagree.

Solving the problem

How could it be that in this time and age, job matching still has to take months?

I'll tell you why.

It's because the CV simply doesn't contain enough information for the hirers to make a hiring decision. The corollary is that, to extract additional information from the candidates, each hirer has to invite the candidate for multiple rounds of interview, and each interview set up takes days / weeks to arrange for both sides.

Hence, we endeavour to create a common job application system whereby job seekers just have to answer a set of interview questions once, which is then video recorded, so all hirers can have access to the information and do NOT need to manually interview to ask for those information.

In theory, an AI can eventually conduct the interview much better than the average hiring manager, such that the hiring process is more objective and devoid of biases. If that be the case, then the employer can simply jump straight to the final round of interview, and life becomes better for both sides.

About Us

Trusting Social (TS) is an AI Fintech company specialized in assessing credit profiles of consumers in emerging markets combining pioneering AI with large alternative data sources. In 2020 we reached our ambitious milestone of credit profiling 1bn consumers spanning 4 countries---Vietnam, Indonesia, India & the Philippines---and building a platform for the wider industry and the financial services industry in particular to provide the 'un & under' served access to credit. At the core of this initiative has been our strict and unwavering adherence to the norms of consumer data privacy and consumer data rights.

But we're not satisfied as we embark on the next leg of our journey to deliver 100 million credit lines to consumers in the markets where we operate. Although this goal is ambitious, we truly believe that by harnessing the power of AI & Big Data we can deliver financial access at unprecedented scale.

As a firm, we're audacious problem solvers motivated by our impact on society. We deeply espouse the values of ownership - of our actions and initiatives, integrity in all we do and agility in execution.

We are partnering with banks which are embracing changes toward digital banking. These changes are exciting but complex, and we are looking for team members who are motivated by big challenges and are ready to dive headlong into helping us grapple with complexity, build solutions, and turn our visions into a reality. Join us, if you have the talent and desire to deliver financial access for all by advancing data science and technology.
