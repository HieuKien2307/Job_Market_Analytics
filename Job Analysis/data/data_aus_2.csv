Are you a Dabbler?

A Dabbler’s attitude is paramount, as the right person will be able to learn quickly and adapt to any skill gaps. A Dabbler is always a team player, with a willingness to share with and learn from others. Being a remote-first workplace, collaborative working styles are crucial to empower and grow each individual member (eg we prefer openness via public channels to problem solve or ideate on Slack).


A Dabbler uses their freedom of autonomy to its absolute potential and enjoys contributing to the Dabble community. We hold respect for our peers very highly – there is no such thing as a bad idea. We encourage you to think differently, be brave and strive to always raise the bar. Dabble was born out of thought sharing and should tackle growth in the same way. Dabble embraces empowerment of all people at any level of seniority and experience to ‘own their work’ and ‘talk their book’ wherever they can.

A fulfilling life extends beyond work, and we encourage our employees to prioritise self-care and well-being. This means taking breaks when needed, setting boundaries, and seeking support when facing challenges. We are committed to creating a safe environment where individuals feel comfortable discussing their wellbeing and accessing resources when necessary.

Are you a Dabbler?

A Dabbler’s attitude is paramount, as the right person will be able to learn quickly and adapt to any skill gaps. A Dabbler is always a team player, with a willingness to share with and learn from others. Being a remote-first workplace, collaborative working styles are crucial to empower and grow each individual member (eg we prefer openness via public channels to problem solve or ideate on Slack).


A Dabbler uses their freedom of autonomy to its absolute potential and enjoys contributing to the Dabble community. We hold respect for our peers very highly – there is no such thing as a bad idea. We encourage you to think differently, be brave and strive to always raise the bar. Dabble was born out of thought sharing and should tackle growth in the same way. Dabble embraces empowerment of all people at any level of seniority and experience to ‘own their work’ and ‘talk their book’ wherever they can.

A fulfilling life extends beyond work, and we encourage our employees to prioritise self-care and well-being. This means taking breaks when needed, setting boundaries, and seeking support when facing challenges. We are committed to creating a safe environment where individuals feel comfortable discussing their wellbeing and accessing resources when necessary.

Are you a Dabbler?

A Dabbler’s attitude is paramount, as the right person will be able to learn quickly and adapt to any skill gaps. A Dabbler is always a team player, with a willingness to share with and learn from others. Being a remote-first workplace, collaborative working styles are crucial to empower and grow each individual member (eg we prefer openness via public channels to problem solve or ideate on Slack).

We encourage you to think differently, be brave and strive to always raise the bar. Dabble was born out of thought sharing and should tackle growth in the same way. Dabble embraces empowerment of all people at any level of seniority and experience to ‘own their work’ and ‘talk their book’ wherever they can.

A fulfilling life extends beyond work, and we encourage our employees to prioritise self-care and well-being. This means taking breaks when needed, setting boundaries, and seeking support when facing challenges. We are committed to creating a safe environment where individuals feel comfortable discussing their wellbeing and accessing resources when necessary.

We’re looking for accomplished researchers who are interested in growing their career in the field of quantitative finance. Our Quantitative Researchers apply mathematics, statistics, and programming to solve complex problems found in our trading environment. While the problems we solve at Susquehanna are often different from academia, our problems demand the attention of brilliant minds that have an extraordinary attention to detail and a relentless pursuit of understanding.

What You’ll Do

The general lifecycle of a quant project begins with an idea:


 * This idea can come from anyone: you, the mentor who sits beside you, or someone you meet in the cafeteria.
 * As a Quantitative Researcher, you will investigate that idea by immersing yourself in market data, leveraging tools in mathematics, statistics, and programming.
 * Through your research, you may discover a new pattern that can transform into a trading signal.
 * You will work side-by-side with technologists in order to backtest your results and put that trading signal into production.
 * Once that signal is embedded in our electronic trading strategies, you will continue to do research on that strategy in order to optimize its performance.
 * As your trading strategy evolves, you will discuss with other researchers, strategists, and traders to collect feedback and brainstorm new ideas.
 * Some of those ideas will turn into new quant projects, and the life cycle starts all over again.
   
   

We have a comprehensive orientation program designed to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Education topics include an introduction to options pricing, exposure to our proprietary data sets, and opportunities to practice data analysis techniques. Beyond orientation, our trading floor serves as an unlimited source of discussion for learning and development.

Read about Robert’s ‘Day in the life’ as a Quantitative Researcher .

What We're Looking For


 * Honours or Master's degree in a quantitative field such as Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Operations Research, or Economics
 * Exceptional mathematical problem-solving skills
 * Solid communication skills, both in the ability to understand others and to make yourself clearly understood
 * Strong, practical computing skills; a specific language proficiency is less important than your ability to get computers to accomplish tasks efficiently and reliably
 * Experience working on in-depth research projects
 * Finance experience is not a requirement
   
   

What’s In It For You


 * Our market leading education program, incorporating classroom theory, simulated learning, and a secondment to our Philadelphia office is renowned to set graduates up for success.
 * Our non-hierarchical culture allows employees of every level to thrive and have an impact. We are not your typical trading firm – the environment is casual, collaborative and we focus on continuous development.
 * Highly competitive remuneration, attractive bonus, and additional leave entitlements.
