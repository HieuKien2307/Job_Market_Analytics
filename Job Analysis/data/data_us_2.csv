Are you looking for a fully remote position where you can contribute to the mission of combating preventable blindness and improving lives? Join us in helping patients preserve their vision and live healthier, longer lives through tailored, timely, and intelligent care. This could be the perfect opportunity for you!

About Lumata Health

Blindness is a devastating—but largely preventable—consequence of poorly managed chronic eye diseases like glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration. These debilitating diseases are expected to double between 2020 and 2050, outpacing the capacity of providers and contributing to the rising cost of eye disorders in the US, which already exceeds $99B in direct medical costs annually. In over 95% of cases, disease progression can be slowed or stopped, preserving vision and extending healthspan. But doing so requires tailored, timely, and intelligent engagement throughout the patient's lifelong care journey. That's where Lumata comes in.

Lumata Health is leading the way in leveraging data-driven virtual care management to address this large and rapidly growing problem. Built with $2M in funding support from the National Eye Institute, Lumata Health's Intelligent Engagement Platform maximizes the impact of multichannel, personalized engagement by our team of JCAHPO-certified ophthalmic care coaches. Lumata takes a holistic approach to care—combining behavioral and psychosocial information with clinical data to create tailored, high-impact patient engagements. In addition to promoting adherence, we help patients overcome barriers to care by assisting with things like financial assistance programs, prescriptions and refills, insurance issues, transportation to visits, understanding their disease and care plan, and coordinating care with other providers.

With direct medical record access to hundreds of thousands of patients with vision-threatening chronic eye diseases and partnerships with over 1,400 eye care specialists in 34 states, Lumata Health is helping people affected by chronic eye conditions live healthier, longer lives.

We're looking for caring and committed teammates to join our mission of helping people see the world. If you're passionate about stopping preventable blindness, we hope you'll apply.

More about Recidiviz

Recidiviz was an all-volunteer effort until early 2019, when Clementine, Andrew, and Joshua founded the organization. Since then, we've built an A-team of software engineers, designers, product managers and domain experts, from companies like Google, Apple, Dropbox, Opower, and Sidewalk Labs. Recidiviz was part of Y-Combinator's 2019 class and has received support from some of the most respected philanthropists and foundations, including Ford Foundation, Mackenzie Scott, Schmidt Futures, Arnold Ventures, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and the Mozilla Foundation.

Today, Recidiviz works with (and earns revenue from) over 15 state partners – big and small, red and blue – and covers more than 40% of the US incarcerated population. We have helped to get tens of thousands of people out of the criminal justice system, safely and equitably, and saved states nearly $1 billion. In the next five years, Recidiviz plans to partner with 40 states and help 250,000 people who are stuck in the system to get out and stay out. In addition to partnering with state Departments of Corrections, Recidiviz collaborates with and learns from partners – from organizations like the Correctional Leaders Association (CLA) to community based organizations and justice-impacted individuals, whose perspectives guide our work.

 * Embrace humanity. We lead with empathy and authenticity, presuming competence and good intentions. When we stumble, we use the opportunity to learn and grow stronger.

The Tech Job market has been affected by massive layoffs and since 2021 there have been more than 600,000.00 tech layoffs.

Good news is that the Fed Reserve has cut interest rates which should boost tech hiring however tech companies will still only hire the best candidates and would not over hire. Also there are a large number of laid off techies who would want to get hired first. To ensure candidates get hired they need to be better than the other Jobseekers.

The Job market is Hyper Competitive. For 1 position 500-1000 candidates or more are applying and laid off job seekers are also competing for entry level Job positions.

We are...

IV.AI is the world's leading language processing AI platform. We have grown fast, but aim to retain our scrappy nature that enabled us to build big AI models that outperform the industry standards. There are many companies right now that talk about the potential impact of AI while we hustle hard and have actually proven the benefits repeatedly.

Helpful

We help people become smarter by using AI or data generated by AI models - the increased human intelligence is driven via a polished AI product that makes sense of noisy social media data, documents, web data, podcasts, internal or external communications. IV.AI takes problems that were previously too complex to manage because of the scope of the research and tracking needed to solve them and makes them easy to solve via high-quality data, easy to use tools and experienced, helpful teams.

Inclusive

Our inclusive culture values people regardless of their background, education or upbringing. In order to train machines to act appropriately, we need builders and contributors who are representative of the entire population. AI is only as good as the teams working on it and the training they receive. AI is incredibly powerful and human bias in the training process can be equally harmful to the world if the technology is not being managed by teams of people who are diverse and considerate.

Hardworking

In just 5 years IV.AI has built a scalable platform with 100s of AI solutions for Fortune 500 companies including Sony, Walmart, Toyota, Netflix, Time Warner, Fox, Capital One, Estée Lauder, to name a few.

Professional

Being professional and respectful of clients and coworkers is of the utmost importance. We work with blue-chip clients and with very sensitive data that requires care and diligence via our focussed security systems and protocols.

Collaborative

Our employees are constantly problem-solving and assessing their own output to maximise delivery. It's important that our team is always looking for the best way of addressing problems so we can manage customer expectations.",Associate,3901583504,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/da2-data-analyst-at-iv-ai-3901583504?trk=public_jobs_topcard-title,"Los Angeles, CA",8 months ago,,,2024-04-16,"$50,000.00/yr - $80,000.00/yr",Non-profit Organizations and Primary and Secondary Education,DA2 Data Analyst,Engineering
